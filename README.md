Photos:



Prints:

Every 'Photo' should end up on a 'Print' at least once.

A standard 'Print' is comprised of two 'Photos'.

At first there are no 'Prints'. The user should be able to generate the initial set of 'Prints' by clicking a button.


Project:

A 'Project' is a collection of 'Prints' that are downloaded at one time, typically bundled as a zip.

A 'Project' has zero or many 'Prints' and a 'Print' belongs to zero or many 'Projects'

A user should be able to add/remove 'Prints' to 'Projects' without deleting the actual 'Print.'
